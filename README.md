# Python-Text-Adventure

Overview
This is a Python-based text adventure game that takes players through a mystical forest filled with choices, creatures, and treasures. As my first coding project, it represents an early exploration of game development using fundamental programming concepts.

Game Features
    - Branching narrative with multiple endings
    - Randomized encounters and rewards
    - Character stat management (health, attack, defense)
    - Scoring system that affects game outcomes
    - Two distinct gameplay modes: story path and endless combat
    - Interactive choices that shape the adventure


Technical Implementation
    - Built entirely in Python using core programming concepts:
    - Functions to organize game logic
    - Global variables for game state
    - Randomization for varied gameplay
    - User input handling
    - Basic text display with timed delays


How to Play
 1 - Run the Python script
 2 - Follow the on-screen prompts
 3 - Make choices that affect your journey
 4 - Manage your character's stats
 5 - Discover one of several possible endings

Project Significance
    As a first coding project, this demonstrates:
        - Fundamental Python syntax
        - Basic game loop implementation
        - Simple combat mechanics
        - Narrative structure in code
        - User interaction design


The game was created to practice core programming skills while building something interactive and fun.
